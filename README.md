1. This data set consists of component- and system-level fragility models for 26 groups of concrete bridges in California. Multiple fragility models are compiled for each component/system in each bridge group. 

2. Variables, terms, nomenclatures, references, and explanations of the data set can be found in the following data paper: 

  Chen S, Xie Y, Wu C, Burton H, Padgett J, Zsarn√≥czay A. Second-Generation component and system-level seismic fragility models for concrete bridges in California. Earthquake Spectra. 2025 (submitted).

3. Fragility models with parameters N/A represent those with damage probabilities approach 0. 

4. No fragility model currently exists for single-span bridges in California. The database selects models developed by Cavalcante (2022) as an approximation for single-span, seat-type abutment bridges in California.
